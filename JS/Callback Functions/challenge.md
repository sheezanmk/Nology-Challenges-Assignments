Room 1
Write a function which takes a sentence and capitalizes each word in that sentence e.g capitaliseEachWord("hello there my name is Alex") -> "Hello There My Name Is Alex"

Room 2
Write a function which takes a sentence and reverses each word in that sentence e.g reverseEachWord("hello there my name is Alex") -> "olleh ereht ym eman si xelA"

Room 3
Write a function which takes a sentence and shouts each word (upper case plus exclaimation point) e.g shoutEachWord("hell there my name is Alex") -> "HELLO! THERE! MY! NAME! IS! ALEX!"

If you know about array iterators like map, for this challenge pretend you don't

Your job is to write an function called modifySentence which takes two arguments, a sentence and a callback function. It should apply that callback function to each word in the sentence

Use this to do the three above challenges
Come up with one of your own
